							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>	Joe Bushnell, our Dad, is a Louisiana born transplant to Seattle, WA,
								where he has made his home since 1959. Dad developed the carefully selected blend of seasonings in 1983.
									Broussard's Creole Foods offers a variety of gourmet seasoning solutions for 
								restaurants, specialty stores, state & federal government cafeterias, hotels, 
								cruise ships, and business enterprises.
							  </p>
							  
							  <p>	When Dad isn't promoting Broussard's in the marketplace, he spends his time cooking
								and develops recipes for his recipe booklets. Check out the recipe booklet.
								for traditional Creole or Cajun favorites such as gumbo, boudin, and etouffee.
							   		Whether you're preparing meat, vegetables, or seafood, you can
								add the wonderful flavor of Broussard's Creole Seasoning. The original recipe was
								passed to Dad from his father who used it to cure meat in southern Louisiana. 
								Marinating ham and sausage with the spices and herbs before smoking gives them an
								incredible taste. Beef, pork, and chicken dishes, gumbo, catfish, french fries, sauces
								stews, and soups are among the many dishes enhanced by Broussard's Creole Seasoning.
